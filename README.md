## Development Server
Get into server directory and run `ruby server.rb` to start the server at port 2000.
When you see the message 'Server start at port 2000' you need to open a new command line. You can run this new command line from any directory.
In this new command line, you can send the commands.

## Send commands
To send commands you need to install netcat, gnu-netcat or any similar tool. After you install the tool, you need to run it according the steps of the tool you have installed. For example, to run netcat you must execute `netcat localhost 2000`. Other alternative is gnu-netcat. With this tool you must run `nc -v localhost 2000`.
